example: ?

% In the case \Safe and \Bad are both downward closed, they can both be finite.

\begin{theorem}\label{down-down}
The resilience problem is undecidable for WSTS with
%	with more than one minimal element, 
$\Safe=\downarrow \Safe$
and $\Bad=\downarrow \Bad$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In the case of a WSTS with at least two minimal elements $m_1$ and $m_2$, the problem of whether $m_2$ is reachable from $m_1$ reduces itself to the resilience problem, hence its undecidability.  
\mathieu{dévellopper un peu la preuve, $m_2$ minimal de $\Safe$, $m_1$ minimal de $\Bad$...}
\end{proof}

In the case of a WSTS with only one minimal element,  
% (ex: Petri Nets and their «Zero») 
then by downward closure the minimal element is present in both $\Safe$ and $\Bad$ and hence resilience always hold.

\begin{theorem}
The resilience problem is decidable for WSTS with 
%	more than one minimal element, 
$\Safe=\downarrow \Safe$
and $\Bad=\uparrow \Bad$
and
\textcolor{red}{
additional hypothesis.
}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\{J_1, J_2,...,J_n\}$ be the ideal decomposition of $\Safe$ and $\{b_1,b_2,...,b_m\}$ be the (unique) minimal basis of $\Bad$.

Let's assume for now for simplicity's sake that $\Bad = \uparrow \{b\}$ 

As an hypothesis, we assume that $\pred^*(\Safe)$ is downward closed as well.
And let $\{J'_1, J'_2,...,J'_n\}$ be the ideal decomposition of $\pred^*(\Safe)$.

Resilience asks whether 
$ \uparrow \{b\} \subseteq J'_1 \cup J'_2 \cup ... \cup J'_n$.

Of note is that $ \downarrow \{b\} \subseteq J'_1 \cup J'_2 \cup ... \cup J'_n$
if and only if
there exists some $i$ such that
$\downarrow \{b\} \subseteq J'_i$.

\mathieu{Try and find a condition under which "$ \uparrow \{b\} \subseteq J'_1 \cup J'_2 \cup ... \cup J'_n$?" is decidable and/or find an undecidable problem that reduce to a variation on 
"$\uparrow \{b\} \subseteq J'_i$ ?"}
