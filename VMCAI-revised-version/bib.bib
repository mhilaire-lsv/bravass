                  transition systems apply to the \emph{finitely branching}
                  variant. Yet some models (inserting automata, \(\omega\)-Petri
                  nets,~...) are naturally infinitely branching.  Here
                  we develop tools to handle infinitely branching WSTS
                  by exploiting the crucial property that in the
                  (ideal) completion of a well-quasi-ordered set,
                  downward-closed sets are finite unions of
                  ideals. Then, using these tools, we derive
                  decidability results and we delineate the
                  undecidability frontier in the case of the
                  termination, the control-state maintainability and
                  the coverability problems. Coverability and
                  boundedness under new effectivity conditions are
                  shown decidable.}
