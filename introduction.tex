\section{Introduction}\label{section introduction}


{\bf Context.} In the quite informal paper \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/PrasadZ16}, Prasad and Zuck studied resilience of a process to an adversary and they used the framework of WSTS enjoying both upward and downward monotonies to prove the decidability of a kind of resilience.

trop d'hypotheses trop fortes sur les WSTS

{\bf Our contributions}
We introduce a more general definition of resilience generalising the two given in \cite{DBLP:conf/gg/Ozkan22}.
Surprinsingly, the general undecidability statements were not known neither proved.

\begin{itemize}

\item safe clos haut, bad clos par le bas: resilience = reachability d'un clos par le bas (anti-coverability)

\item safe clos haut : resilience indecidable for WSTS with strong.

\end{itemize}
