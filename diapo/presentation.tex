Exemple de motivation


Fridge \quad	Bad state is when temperature is too high \\
\phantom{Fridge}	\quad Good state is temperature low enough \\

Speaking: We are usually focused on how to avoid bad states in general but you can see when your fridge the system stops providing refrigerating temperature it's not over yet
If you leave your fridge off for a minute it's not going to have Terrible impact but if you leave it off for more than one hour you're gonna have to throw the things in it away

And I've been talking like your frige at home but it apply to any type of cooling system it can be like refrigerating medical supplies or nuclear reactor.

And this is interesting Bcz now the stuff is not necessarily avoid bad states completely

This lead to concept of resilience

TODO

Define the Six different problems we study/focus on.

(Takes some room but I think mb having the six on the same page could be better than having three then three state-* on two separate pages ?)

TODO
  
Resilience(s) "obviously"  undecidable in general so restriction

restriction already to WSTS

so we need to define WSTS properly

This is what this slide could be about

Now that everything is somewhat properly defined maybe the picture with all the results ?

  \begin{frame}{Result A}
 
   Now we won't have time to detail all the result. 
   Result blabla are consequences of the paper    by Okzan so let's not delve into it.\\
   ( should still be quite precise about Okzan result)
   
    Let's delve into [This Result] in particular.
   
   Now recall the definitions ...
   
   \pause 
   
   And let's give an intuition behind the proof

  \begin{frame}{Conclusion}
  

How to expand current results ?

- detailed complexity analysis

- controller/environment framework

- other classes of $\Safe / \Bad$
