\section{Resilience for WSTS}


In this section we introduce the concept of resilience for well structured transition systems. We show that the resilience problems are decidable
for  completion-post-effective $\omega^2$-WSTS with strong compatibility
when [...]
and for downward-compatible ideal-effective WSTS
when [...]. 
We show that resilience problems are however undecidable for WSTS with
strong compatibility in general.


In a transition system $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow)$, we consider two subsets of states $\Safe, \Bad \subseteq S$ such that $\Safe \cap  \Bad = \emptyset$ and $\Safe ,  \Bad \neq \emptyset$.
%	The property of mutual exclusion is often modelised with $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$.
The \emph{resilience problem} (resp. the \emph{$k$-resilience problem}) for $(\mathscr{S},\Safe,\Bad)$ is to decide whether from \emph{any} state in $\Bad$, \emph{there exists} a path (resp. a path of length smaller than or equal to $k$) that reaches a state in $\Safe$. We use the notation $\Bad \longrightarrow^{*} \Safe$ (resp. $\Bad \longrightarrow^{\leq k} \Safe$) for $\forall x \in \Bad, \exists y \in \Safe$ such that $x \longrightarrow^{*} y$ (resp.  $\forall x \in \Bad, \exists y \in \Safe$ such that $x \longrightarrow^{\leq k} y$). In our framework, $\Safe, \Bad \subseteq S$  are possibly infinite but they must admit a computable finite representation : for example, downward-closed sets and upward-closed sets in wqo and semilinear sets in $\mathbb{N}^d$ have finite representations. 


{\bf Related problems.} 
A set of configurations $H$ is an {\em home-space} for a set of configurations $X$ if every configuration reachable from $X$ can reach $H$. Resilience as introduced above essentially asks whether $\Safe$ is a home-space for $\Bad$, whereas $k$-resilience and bounded-resilience focus more on the length of the paths from $\Bad$ to $\Safe$. The home-space problem is decidable for
Petri nets when $X$ and $H$ are both semilinear sets~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2207-02697}.
To these author's knowledge, there are no general results for home-space in WSTS.

% \mathieu{vérifier au passage que c'est vrai qu'il y a pas de résultats home-space WSTS}

Resilience and the home-space problem are also linked to the 
model-checking of the ``from-all'' formula $\forall s \in X~ \exists t \in Y~ s \to^* t$
which has been shown decidable for Lossy Counter Machine
when $X$ and $Y$ are semi-linear sets~\cite{DBLP:conf/rp/Schnoebelen10}.
Other decidable formulae include ``one-to-one'' ($\exists s \in  X ~ \exists t \in  Y ~ s \to^* 
 t$), and ``all-to-same'' ($\exists t \in  Y ~ \forall s \in  X ~ s \to^*  t$),
whereas ``one-to-all'' ($\exists s \in  X ~ \forall t \in  Y ~ s \to^*  t$), 
``all-to-all'' ($\forall s \in  X ~ \forall t \in  Y ~ s \to^*  t$)
  and ``to-all'' ($\forall t \in  Y  ~ \exists s \in  X ~ s \to^*  t$) are undecidable (again, for Lossy Counter Machines). 
  


Let us formalize three resilience problems.

%\alain{il faudrait ne pas répéter 3 fois les mêmes imputs pour les 3 pbs: énoncer les 3 uniformes pbs d'un coup avec une fois l'input puis les 3 pbs pour un état s donné sans répéter non plus 3 fois les mêmes inputs}

%We add a third problem that decides whether there exists an $k$ such  that the system is $k$-resilient.
%

\problemx{$k$-resilience problem (kRP)}
{A transition system $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow), k \in \mathbb{N}$ and two sets $\Safe, \Bad \subseteq S$.}
{$\Bad \longrightarrow^{\leq k} \Safe$ ?\newline}

\problemx{bounded resilience problem (BRP)}
{A transition system $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow)$ and two sets $\Safe, \Bad \subseteq S$.}
%{$\exists k \geq 0 ~ \forall s' \in D ~ s \rightarrow^* s' \implies \exists s'' \in U ~ s' \rightarrow^{\leq k} s''$ ?\newline}
{$\exists k \geq 0$ such that $\mathscr{S}$ is %uniformely
 $k$-resilient ?\newline}


\begin{example}
Let us consider a VASS with only one state $q$, one counter, and one transition that substracts $-1$ from the counter, with $\Safe = \downarrow q(0)$, $\Bad = \uparrow q(1)$,
then resilience hold (one always ends up in the positive integers) but not bounded resilience: for every bound $k$ there is an element of $\Bad$ e.g. $q(-k-1)$ which necessitate at least $k+1$ steps before it can reach $\Safe$. 
\end{example}


% \begin{remark}[Reformulation]\label{reformulation}
% $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow,\leq)$ is %uniformely 
% (\Safe, \Bad)-resilient iff $\Bad \subseteq \pred^*(\Safe)$.\\
% $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow,\leq)$ is %uniformely 
% (\Safe, \Bad)-$k$-resilient iff $\Bad \subseteq \pred^{\leq k}(\Safe)$.
% \end{remark}


  
These three resilience problems are decidable for finite transition systems but undecidable for (general) infinite-state transition systems. So we restrict our framework to the class of infinite-state WSTS. Since most of decidable properties in WSTS rely on the computation of upward or downward-closed sets \cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/AbdullaCJT00, DBLP:journals/tcs/FinkelS01}, we consider upward-closed or downward-closed sets $\Safe$ and $\Bad$. In \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-00889}, the authors considered that $\Bad$ is downward-closed and $\Safe$ is upward-closed.

Surprinsingly, we have not found decidability results about the resilience problems for WSTS.

%		
We deduce 
% \textcolor{red}{that the three resilience problems are decidable for all four pairs of sets $\Safe$ and $\Bad$ downward-closed and upward-closed sets.}
% \mathieu{changer ça}
decidability results for the four pairs of sets $\Safe$ and $\Bad$ downward-closed and upward-closed as seen in Section~\ref{synthesis}.

In particular, the existing proofs of resilience use the decidability of reachability; but we wish to decide resilience for models with undecidable reachability.
%
%	 and ideals are recursive 
Our result will rely on coverability instead of reachability. We moreover show undecidability when coverability is not decidable in the case $\Safe = \uparrow \Safe$. 






While considering a sequence of configurations, every prefix is always 
either in the case that the latest visited $\Bad$ configuration has already been followed by a $\Safe$ configuration
or in the case that it still has to. 
Thus, in context, there are no true ``neutral'' configurations: either a neutral configuration is contextually ``$\Safe$'' because it follows a visit in a $\Safe$ configuration, either it is contextually ``$\Bad$'' because it follows a visit in a $\Bad$ configuration and has, accordingly, to reach a $\Safe$ one.
Hence we will consider not only $\Bad$ and $\Safe$ disjoint but
% w.l.o.g.
	also
$\Bad$ complement of $\Safe$,
in which case
if $\Bad$ is downward-closed then $\Safe$ is upward-closed and vice-versa.
Cases where $\Bad$ or $\Safe$ are not complements of each other, and share closure properties, i.e. are both downward-closed or both upward-closed,
have also been studied, 
see 
Appendix~\ref{case down down}
and
Appendix~\ref{case up up} for results.

%We first assume that the safety property is given by an upward-closed set and the bad condition by a decidable downward-closed set. 
% \textcolor{red}{Seems like a reasonable assumption to me.}

%From these considerations, we formulate instances of the abstract resilience problems for well-
%structured transition systems.
