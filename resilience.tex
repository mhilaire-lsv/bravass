\section{Resilience for WSTS}


In this section we introduce the concept of resilience, bounded-resilience and $k$-resilience for well structured transition systems. We show that the resilience problems are decidable
for  completion-post-effective $\omega^2$-WSTS with strong compatibility
in the case $\Bad$ is downward-closed and $\Safe $ is upward-closed,
and that resilience is decidable for downward-compatible ideal-effective WSTS
when $\Safe$ is downward-closed and $\Bad $ is upward-closed. 
We show that the three resilience problems are however undecidable for WSTS with
strong compatibility in general.


In a transition system $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow)$, we consider two subsets of states $\Safe, \Bad \subseteq S$ such that $\Safe \cap  \Bad = \emptyset$ and $\Safe ,  \Bad \neq \emptyset$.
%	The property of mutual exclusion is often modelised with $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$.
The \emph{resilience problem} (resp. the \emph{$k$-resilience problem}) for $(\mathscr{S},\Safe,\Bad)$ is to decide whether from \emph{any} state in $\Bad$, \emph{there exists} a path (resp. a path of length smaller than or equal to $k$) that reaches a state in $\Safe$. We use the notation $\Bad \longrightarrow^{*} \Safe$ (resp. $\Bad \longrightarrow^{\leq k} \Safe$) for $\forall x \in \Bad, \exists y \in \Safe$ such that $x \longrightarrow^{*} y$ (resp.  $\forall x \in \Bad, \exists y \in \Safe$ such that $x \longrightarrow^{\leq k} y$). In our framework, $\Safe, \Bad \subseteq S$  are possibly infinite but they must admit a computable finite representation : for example, downward-closed sets and upward-closed sets in wqo and semilinear sets in $\mathbb{N}^d$ have finite representations. 


{\bf Related problems.} 
A set of configurations $H$ is an {\em home space} for a set of configurations $X$ if every configuration reachable from $X$ can reach $H$. Resilience as introduced above essentially asks whether $\Safe$ is a home space for $\Bad$, whereas $k$-resilience and bounded-resilience focus more on the length of the paths from $\Bad$ to $\Safe$. The home space problem is decidable for
Petri nets when $X$ and $H$ are both semilinear sets~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2207-02697}.
To these author's knowledge, there are no general results for home space in WSTS.

Resilience and the home space problem are also linked to the 
model-checking of the ``from-all'' formula $\forall s \in X~ \exists t \in Y~ s \to^* t$
which has been shown decidable for Lossy Counter Machine
when $X$ and $Y$ are semi-linear sets~\cite{DBLP:conf/rp/Schnoebelen10}.
Other decidable formulae include ``one-to-one'' ($\exists s \in  X ~ \exists t \in  Y ~ s \to^* 
 t$), and ``all-to-same'' ($\exists t \in  Y ~ \forall s \in  X ~ s \to^*  t$),
whereas ``one-to-all'' ($\exists s \in  X ~ \forall t \in  Y ~ s \to^*  t$), 
``all-to-all'' ($\forall s \in  X ~ \forall t \in  Y ~ s \to^*  t$)
  and ``to-all'' ($\forall t \in  Y  ~ \exists s \in  X ~ s \to^*  t$) are undecidable (again, for Lossy Counter Machines). 
  


Let us formalize three resilience problems.

\begin{example}
Let us consider a VASS with only one state $q$, one counter, and one transition that substracts $-1$ from the counter, with $\Safe = \downarrow q(0)$, $\Bad = \uparrow q(1)$,
then resilience hold (one always ends up in the positive integers) but not bounded resilience: for every bound $k$ there is an element of $\Bad$ e.g. $q(-k-1)$ which necessitate at least $k+1$ steps before it can reach $\Safe$. 
\end{example}



  
These three resilience problems are decidable for finite transition systems but undecidable for (general) infinite-state transition systems. So we restrict our framework to the class of infinite-state WSTS. Since most of decidable properties in WSTS rely on the computation of upward or downward-closed sets \cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/AbdullaCJT00, DBLP:journals/tcs/FinkelS01}, we consider upward-closed or downward-closed sets $\Safe$ and $\Bad$. In \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-00889}, the authors considered that $\Bad$ is downward-closed and $\Safe$ is upward-closed. %\mathieu{Remarquer que dans l'example~\ref{Example} on a à la fois upward closed ET downward closed pour $\Safe$ ET $\Bad$.} 
Remark that in Example~\ref{Example}, $\Safe$ and $\Bad$ are both upward-closed and downward-closed.

Surprinsingly, we have not found decidability results about the resilience problems for WSTS.	
We deduce decidability results for the four pairs of sets $\Safe$ and $\Bad$ downward-closed and upward-closed as seen in Section~\ref{synthesis}.
In particular, the existing proofs of resilience use the decidability of reachability; but we wish to decide resilience for models with undecidable reachability.
Our result will rely on coverability instead of reachability. We moreover show undecidability when coverability is not decidable in the case $\Safe = \uparrow \Safe$
and in the general case when $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$.
 






While considering a sequence of configurations, every prefix is always 
either in the case that the latest visited $\Bad$ configuration has already been followed by a $\Safe$ configuration
or in the case that it still has to. 
Thus, in context, there are no true ``neutral'' configurations: either a neutral configuration is contextually ``$\Safe$'' because it follows a visit in a $\Safe$ configuration, either it is contextually ``$\Bad$'' because it follows a visit in a $\Bad$ configuration and has, accordingly, to reach a $\Safe$ one.
Hence we will consider not only $\Bad$ and $\Safe$ disjoint but
% w.l.o.g.
	also
$\Bad$ complement of $\Safe$,
in which case
if $\Bad$ is downward-closed then $\Safe$ is upward-closed and vice-versa.
Cases where $\Bad$ or $\Safe$ are not complements of each other, and share closure properties, i.e. are both downward-closed or both upward-closed,
have also been studied, 
see 
Appendix~\ref{case down down}
and
Appendix~\ref{case up up} for results.
