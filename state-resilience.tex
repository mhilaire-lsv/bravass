Resilience is a strong property since it implies that from every element of $\Bad$ there must exist a path to $\Safe$. However, when one considers a system with an initial state $s_0$, it could be sufficient to ask that only from $\Bad \cap \post^*(s_0)$, there must exist a path to $\Safe$. 
In the {\bf Flight Controller System} example for instance, $(q_{A,1}, q_{M,4}, q_{B,0})(\textbf{0})$
belongs to $\Bad$, but is not reachable from $(q_{A,0}, q_{M,0}, q_{B,0})(\textbf{0})$,
hence it may seem unnecessary to check for the existence of a path to $\Safe$ from this element.
Since we still consider $\Bad$ and $\Safe$ complements of each others, this is akin to asking whether from $\post^*(s_0)$ there always exists a path to $\Safe$. 
The three previous problems become:




\problemx{State-resilience problem (SRP)}
{A transition system $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow)$, $s \in S$ and two sets $\Safe \subseteq S$.}
% {$\Bad \cap \post^*(s)  \rightarrow^{*} \Safe $ ? \newline}
{$\post^*(s)  \rightarrow^{*} \Safe $ ? \newline}

% { $\Bad \cap \post^*(s) \longrightarrow^{\leq k} \Safe$ ?  \newline}
{ $\post^*(s) \longrightarrow^{\leq k} \Safe$ ?  \newline}

\problemx{bounded-state-resilience problem (BSRP)}
{A transition system $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow)$, $s \in S$ and two sets $\Safe \subseteq S$.}
{$\exists k \geq 0$ such that $\mathscr{S}$ is $k$-state-resilient ?\newline}

\fi


Since these problems are undecidable for general infinite-state transition systems, we restrict our study to WSTS.
As in the Section~3, we study decidability results for $\Safe$ downward-closed and upward-closed. 


\subsection{Case: $\Safe = \uparrow \Safe$% and $\Bad = \downarrow \Bad$
}

We start with the case $\Safe = \uparrow \Safe$ hence $\Bad = \downarrow \Bad$.
%
Unfortunately, in this case {\sc State-resilience} is undecidable for (general) WSTS even with strong upward-compatibility.
This stems from the fact that it is undecidable in the particular case of reset-VASS,
where  $t$-liveness is both undecidable and 
 reducible to {\sc State-resilience}. This undecidability result furthermore implies the undecidability of the other two state resilience problems by straightforward reductions.


\begin{theorem}\label{srp up down}
{\sc State-resilience},
{\sc Bounded-state-resilience} and
{\sc $k$-state-resilience}
are undecidable for strongly compatible WSTS with effective pred-basis
when
$\Safe=\uparrow \Safe$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
{\sc State-resilience} itself is undecidable % from Proposition~\ref{reductions} 
since 
{\sc $t$-liveness} is undecidable in reset-VASS
and reducible to {\sc State-resilience}.
Additionally, in WSTS with strong compatibility and effective pred-basis, {\sc Bounded-state-resilience} is
reducible to {\sc $k$-state-resilience}:
since $\Safe=\uparrow \Safe$ and
$\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow,\leq)$ is a WSTS with strong %upward-
compatibility, then $\pred^{\leq n}(\Safe)= \uparrow~\pred^{\leq n}(\Safe)$ for all $n \in \N$,
and there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that 
$\pred^{\leq n_0}(\Safe) = \uparrow \pred^{\leq n_0}(\Safe) = \uparrow \pred^*(\Safe) = \pred^*(\Safe)$.
We compute 
$n_0$, then iteratively check whether $k$-state-resilience 
hold for $k$ from $0$ to $n_0$.  
Furthermore, in WSTS with strong compatibility and effective pred-basis,  $\Safe=\uparrow \Safe$, {\sc Bounded-state-resilience} is equivalent to {\sc State-resilience},
since 
$\pred^{\leq n_0}(\Safe) = \uparrow \pred^{\leq n_0}(\Safe) = {\uparrow \pred^*(\Safe)} = \pred^*(\Safe)$.
Hence the undecidability of {\sc Bounded-state-resilience}
and 
 {\sc $k$-state-resilience}. 
\end{proof}






On the positive side, let us recall a result about {\sc Bounded-state-resilience} decidability (called resilience in \cite{DBLP:conf/gg/Ozkan22,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-00889}).
\begin{theorem}\cite{DBLP:conf/gg/Ozkan22,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-00889}\label{ref ozkan}
{\sc Bounded-state-resilience} and {\sc $k$-state-resilience} are decidable for WSTS $S$ with strong compatibility and such that $\uparrow \post^*(s)$ is computable for $s \in S$
when
$\Safe=\uparrow \Safe$.
\end{theorem}

We may immediately generalyse this last result by strengthening to \emph{unbounded} {\sc State-resilience}. The proof is essentially the same than the previous one.

\begin{corollary}\label{postcomputable}
{\sc State-resilience} is decidable for WSTS with strong compatibility and such that $\uparrow \post^*(s)$ is computable for $s \in S$
when
$\Safe=\uparrow \Safe$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
%From Fact~\ref{stop condition},
Since $\mathscr{S}$ is a WSTS there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$\pred^*(\Safe) =  \pred^{\leq n_0}(\Safe)$. We can compute this $n_0$ by iteratively computing 
%\alain{mauvaises notations: $k, k_m, Safe^k,...$ n'a aucun sens...}
$\pred^{\leq n+1}(\Safe)$ from $\pred^{\leq n}(\Safe)$, checking 
$\pred^{\leq n+1}(\Safe) = \pred^{\leq n}(\Safe)$, 
returning $n$ if that is the case.
Then, because {\sc $n_0$-state-resilience} is decidable, 
checking $\uparrow \post^*(s) %\cap \Bad
 \subseteq \pred^{\leq n}(\Safe) = \pred^*(\Safe)$ is,
and {\sc State-resilience} is decidable.
\end{proof}

The proof of Theorem~\ref{ref ozkan} rely on the computability of $\uparrow \post^*(s)$ and on the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma intersection}
Let $A \subseteq S$, $D \subseteq S$ be a downward-closed set and $U \subseteq S$ be an upward-closed set. 
Then $A \cap D \subseteq U$  iff $ (\uparrow  A) \cap D \subseteq U$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
Let us suppose that $A \cap D \subseteq U$. Then ${\uparrow (A \cap D)} \subseteq {\uparrow U} = U$.
Let us show that $({\uparrow A}) \cap D \subseteq {\uparrow (A \cap D)}$.
Let $x \in ({\uparrow A}) \cap D$, then there exists $a \in A$ such that $x \geq a$.
Since $x \in D$ and $D$ is downward-closed, we also have $a \in D$.
Hence $a \in A \cap D$ and then $x \in { \uparrow (A \cap D)}$.
In the other direction,
since $A \subseteq {\uparrow A}$, the inclusion
$({\uparrow  A}) \cap D \subseteq U$ implies
$A \cap D \subseteq ({\uparrow  A}) \cap D \subseteq U$.
\end{proof}




The computability of $\uparrow \post^*(s)$ however seems a strong hypothesis. What are the WSTS for which $\uparrow \post^*(s)$ is computable for $s \in S$ ?
Ozkan \cite{DBLP:conf/gg/Ozkan22} argues that it is precisely the WSTS for which the following problem is decidable.

\problemx{Downward-reachability problem}
{A transition system $\mathscr{S}=(S,\rightarrow)$, $s \in S$ and a downward-closed set $D
\subseteq S$.}
{$s  \to^* D$? \newline}

%\"Ozkan
\begin{proposition}[Proposition 1 in \cite{DBLP:conf/gg/Ozkan22}]\label{post*}
For finite-branching WSTS%with strong compatibility
, a basis of $\uparrow \post^*(s)$ is computable for every state $s$ iff the downward-reachability problem is decidable.
\end{proposition}


The idea behind the proof is the following. For deciding whether a downward-closed set $D$ is reachable from $s$, one checks whether
$B_{\uparrow \post^*(s)} \cap D = \emptyset$, 
where $B_{\uparrow \post^*(s)}$ is a basis of $\uparrow \post^*(s)$,
%\alain{rapeler $B_{\uparrow \post^*(s)}$} 
 that is equivalent to $\post^*(s)\cap D = \emptyset$ by
Lemma~\ref{Lemma intersection}. For the converse direction, one computes the sequence of upward-closed sets
$U_n = \uparrow \post^{\leq n}(s)$ until it becomes stationnary. 
Decidability of downward-reachability leads to the decidability of the following stop condition:
asking whether $S \setminus U_n$ is reachable from $s$.





More concretely,
VASS for instance are $\uparrow \post^*$-effective WSTS \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-00889}. 
It is well-known that 
VASS are WSTS with strong compatibility and since there is an algorithm that computes a finite basis of  $\uparrow \post^*(s)$, \cite{DBLP:conf/gg/Ozkan22} deduced that {\sc Bounded-state-resilience} is decidable for VASS.
Hence {\sc State-resilience} is decidable for %both Petri nets and 
VASS.
However, the hypothesis that $\uparrow \post^*$ is computable cannot be tested in the general WSTS framework.  \iffalse Moreover, we may show:

\begin{proposition}
There exist classes of WSTSs with strong 
 compatibility for which there doesn't exist an algorithm computing a basis of $\uparrow \post^*$.
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
Let us show that reset-VASS, that are effective WSTSs with strong compatibility, don't enjoy the property that $\uparrow \post^*$ is computable.
Suppose that one are able to compute a finite basis of $\uparrow \post^*$ for reset-VASS. 
Then, {\sc State-resilience} would be decidable for reset-VASS, which leads to a contradiction.
\end{proof} \fi
Moreover there exist classes of WSTSs with strong 
 compatibility for which there doesn't exist an algorithm computing a basis of $\uparrow \post^*$, such as reset-VASS.

Keeping the $\uparrow \post^*$ effectiveness hypothesis but loosening the strong compatibility one still yields some decidability result for the general {\sc State-resilience}. Using the same proof structure as Theorem 1 from \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-00889} we obtain:


\begin{theorem}\label{post srp}
{\sc State-resilience} is decidable for 
 WSTS with effective 
$\uparrow$ $\post^*$ basis
when
$\Safe=\uparrow \Safe$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
Let $B_{\uparrow \post^*(s)}$ 
%\alain{notation fluctuante}
 be a basis of $\uparrow \post^*(s)$, $B_\Safe$ a basis of $\Safe$.
By applying Lemma~\ref{Lemma intersection} twice, we obtain
\[ \post^*(s) %\cap \Bad
 \subseteq \pred^*(\Safe) \text{ iff } B_{\uparrow \post^*(s)} %\cap \Bad 
 \subseteq \pred^*(\Safe)\]
Since $B_{\uparrow \post^*(s)}$ is finite and we can compute a basis of $\pred^*(\Safe)$ from $B_\Safe$, we can check that $B_{\uparrow \post^*(s)} %\cap \Bad
 \setminus \pred^*(\Safe) = \emptyset$. 
\end{proof}





However when removing strong compatibility, precision is lost.
Since $\pred(\uparrow \Safe)$ is not necessarily upward-closed, it is possible to have 
 $\uparrow \post^* (s) \cap S \not\subseteq \pred(\Safe)$,
despite having 
$\post^* (s) \cap S \subseteq \pred( \Safe)$.
In such a case the algorithm from
\cite{DBLP:conf/gg/Ozkan22} would deduce that $1$-rechable-resilience does not hold,
which is incorrect.

Thus in case of a WSTS with an effective basis of $\uparrow \post^*$ and (not strong) compatibility, we don't know the decidability status of {\sc $k$-state-resilience} and 
{\sc Bounded-state-resilience}.

\subsection{Case: $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$% and $\Bad = \uparrow \Bad$
}


We now consider the case $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$ hence $\Bad = \uparrow \Bad$.
%
Unfortunately the {\sc State-resilience} problem is undecidable for WSTS in the case $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$. As for resilience in WSTS when $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$, it stems from undeciability of the corresponding problem in Minsky machines, the executions of which can be simulated by reset-VASS, as seen in Appendix~\ref{HS-Minsk}. 

\begin{theorem}\label{srp down up}
{\sc State-resilience} is undecidable for effective WSTS with  strong  compatibility 
when
$\Safe=\downarrow \Safe$.
\end{theorem}



Despite this, it is possible to yield positive results. Indeed, in many ways the case where $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$
is symmetrical to the case $\Safe = \uparrow \Safe$.
%
For instance one can write the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}(Symmetrical from Lemma~\ref{Lemma intersection})\label{Lemma intersection 2}
Let $A \subseteq S$, $D \subseteq S$ be a downward-closed set and $U \subseteq S$ be an upward-closed set. 
Then $A \cap U \subseteq D$  iff $ (\downarrow  A) \cap U \subseteq D$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us suppose that $A \cap U \subseteq D$. Then ${\downarrow (A \cap U)} \subseteq {\downarrow D} = D$. Let us show that $({\downarrow A}) \cap U \subseteq {\downarrow (A \cap U)}$. Let $x \in ({\downarrow A}) \cap U$, then there exists $a \in A$ such that $x \leq a$. Since $x \in U$ and $U$ is upward-closed, we also have $a \in U$. Hence $a \in A \cap U$ and then $x \in { \downarrow (A \cap U)}$. In the other direction, since $A \subseteq {\downarrow A}$, the inclusion $({\downarrow  A}) \cap U \subseteq D$ implies $A \cap U \subseteq ({\uparrow  A}) \cap U \subseteq D$.
\end{proof}


In the case of a WSTS with \emph{downward} compatibility, not necessarily strong,
then $\Safe$ downward-closed implies $\pred^*(\Safe)$ downward-closed and
Lemma~\ref{Lemma intersection 2} can be used to show that
if $\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$,
then
$\post^*(s) %\cap \Bad 
\subseteq \pred^*(\Safe)$  iff $ (\downarrow  \post^*(s)) 
%\cap \Bad 
\subseteq \pred^*(\Safe)$.


\begin{theorem}\label{downward srp}
{\sc State-resilience} is decidable for ideal-effective WSTS with downward and upward compatibilities,
$\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In order to decide whether $\post^{\leq n}(s) %\cap \Bad
 \subseteq \pred^*(\Safe)$, we execute two procedures in parallel,
one looking for a resilience certificate and one looking for a non-resilience certificate.
Procedure 1 enumerates inductive invariants in some fixed order $D_1$ , $D_2$ , $\ldots$ , i.e. downward-closed subsets $D_i \subseteq S$ such that $\downarrow \post(D_i ) \subseteq D_i$. 
Every inductive invariant $D_i$ is an “over-approximation” of $\downarrow \post^*(s)$ if it contains $s$.
Notice that, by 
upward compatibility, $\downarrow \post^*(s)$ is such an inductive invariant and may eventually be found.

Procedure 1 stops when it finds an invariant $D$ such that
$D  %\cap \Bad
 \subseteq \pred^*(\Safe)$. 
Indeed
$D % \cap \Bad 
\subseteq  \pred^*(\Safe)$ implies
$\downarrow \post^*(s) % \cap \Bad
 \subseteq  \pred^*(\Safe)$
since $ \downarrow \post^*(s)  \subseteq D$.

The second procedure iteratively computes
$\post^{\leq n}(s) %\cap \Bad
$
until it finds an element
not in $\pred^*(\Safe)$.
\end{proof}



Strong downward compatibility implies furthermore the decidability
of {\sc $k$-state-resilience} and {\sc bounded-state-resilience}.

\begin{corollary}\label{downward brp}
{\sc $k$-state-resilience} and {\sc bounded-state-resilience} are decidable for ideal-effective WSTS with strong downward compatibility,
$\Safe = \downarrow \Safe$.
\end{corollary}
